Practice 2: 
nstructions:
Controls:
Press 'A': Move the character from right to left (left-facing animation).
Press 'S': Move the character from left to right (right-facing animation).
Press 'D': Stop the character's movement.
Press 'Esc': Exit the game.
Requirements:
Compiler: Use a C++ compiler that supports the EasyX library (recommended: Visual Studio).
Libraries: Make sure graphics.h, EasyXPng.h, and windows.h are included in your project files.
File Descriptions:
Source Code: Contains the main game logic.
Image Files:
g0.png to g3.png: Left-facing animation images.
g4.png to g7.png: Right-facing animation images.
bg.png: Background image file.
Setup:
Place all images (g0.png to g7.png for character sprites and bg.png for the background) in the project directory.
Compile and run the program using Visual Studio or another C++ IDE compatible with EasyX.
Game Logic:
The program continuously monitors for key presses to control the characterâ€™s movement.
The character begins from either the left or right edge of the screen based on the selected direction and moves across until reaching the opposite edge.
If the D key is pressed, the character halts and remains stationary until A or S is pressed to move again.

Practice 1: 
Instructions:
Left-Right Movement: The character moves left-to-right and right-to-left, switching directions when it reaches the screen edges.
Seamless Background Scrolling: The background scrolls in a loop to provide a continuous effect, enhancing immersion.
Requirements:
Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler that supports EasyX (Visual Studio is recommended).
Libraries: Include graphics.h, EasyXPng.h, and conio.h in the project files.
File Descriptions:
Source Code: Contains the main game logic.
Image Files:
g0.png, g1.png, g2.png, g3.png: Character images for animation (must be stored in the same directory as the code).
bg.png: Background image file for seamless scrolling.
Setup:
Place all images (g0.png to g3.png for character sprites and bg.png for the background) in the project's directory.
Compile and run the game using your IDE or a C++ compiler compatible with the EasyX library.
Controls:
The game runs automatically without user input, with the character moving autonomously across the screen.
